Today I didn’t do much — just played a bit on Rollercoin and talked to my friend, who told me he traveled to a nearby town. 
He also mentioned that his daughter was unfortunately diagnosed with a disease (I can’t remember the name right now). 
I really hope she gets better, especially since the baby has just started walking.
Later at night, I decided to listen to some American rap to clear my mind from everything that’s happened to me over the years.
