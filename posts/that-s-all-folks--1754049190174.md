Today we started the day “well”… I do everything I can to win someone over, but either the person is never the way I want or no one shows up at all.
I’m already waiting for the Apocalypse, but while that doesn’t happen, I decided to watch a bit of Looney Tunes and forget about these bad things that sometimes happen to me.
At least I have my health…
And I really do, since I’m pretty chubby haha.
I made a post about the Banano community yesterday and decided to share it on Reddit to see if I can get some money from it. Maybe I’ll get lucky and someone will see my post and decide to donate me some bananos.
I wonder if there’s another community like this one? There are so many cryptocurrency options that I don’t even know which ones are worth it anymore.
It’s amazing how quickly I lose interest in things. Yesterday, for example, I tried going out at night, but because of lack of motivation and fear, I decided to go back home — it was already late anyway.
Unfortunately, that’s how nights are here — full of criminals.
Maybe one day that’ll change, but who knows when hehe.
