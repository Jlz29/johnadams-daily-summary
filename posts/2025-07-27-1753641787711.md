Today I woke up at 8 a.m. and decided to watch some videos on YouTube. Unfortunately, I’m still sad about the passing of Ozzy Osbourne, but I decided not to watch anything related to him throughout the day (will I be able to stick to that? haha).
I was going to talk about a dream I had involving a comedian, but I don’t really remember it…
I talked a bit with my mom and now I don’t know what to do.

Oh, I just remembered something else I did today: I went on Threads and read some posts there, but most of the posts are from lonely or depressed people (which makes me wonder if maybe I’m like that too).
Sometimes I like looking at some women on Threads, but it’s a shame they don’t care about me.

Yesterday I forgot to mention that I decided to mine Polygon and RLT on my Rollercoin account so that I can get more miners in the future.
For those who don’t know, Rollercoin is a cloud mining website where people choose a cryptocurrency and decide whether it’s a good idea to mine it or not.

If you don’t have an account and you’re interested (you’re not required to invest any money in the game, and you can sign up for free), here’s my referral link: https://rollercoin.com/?r=kusmgh54

My mom just said she fried some eggs, but I don’t like eating them—I hate the smell, and she knows that. Fortunately, eggs aren’t the only food we have at home that smells like a fart.
Another thing I forgot to mention is that I woke up thinking about starting to go to the gym because I’m really overweight and can’t run properly, but since it’s very cold where I live, I decided to think about it again when summer arrives.

Speaking of weather, have you noticed how people only talk about that these days?
No one talks about shows, movies, or books anymore—it’s always the same old line: “Hot today, isn’t it?”
With so many interesting topics out there, people still choose to talk only about the weather, and I don’t get why that happens…
Could it be because of the floods and people are traumatized? But that didn’t happen in every country, just some, so it can’t be the only reason…

I hate envy. When I told a friend of mine about Bitcoin, he said he started mining Bitcoin on his phone—but before that, he didn’t know a thing. Now he decided to do it just because I told him I had an account on Rollercoin.

Jesus Christ! Give me patience with these envious people. If people saw me in real life, they wouldn’t be envious—they’d feel sorry for me…

Now I’ve decided to get up and change clothes, but I still don’t know what I’m going to eat—I woke up without an appetite too.

I was talking to a friend yesterday and realized that TV doesn’t show anything good anymore—it’s all just tragedies, and I don’t like watching that kind of content because it makes me scared afterward.
Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever turn on the TV and find something decent and high-quality like in the good old days (a few years ago), when they used to show great cartoons like Dragon Ball Z, and many others.

It’s now 3:39 p.m., and just a moment ago, I saw a girl entering the building where I live—man, she was stunning, really beautiful. Too bad I think she’s way too young for me, unfortunately.

Now I’m listening to an Ozzy Osbourne song called “Mama, I’m Coming Home” and remembering how amazing his music was while he was alive...
