Today it was very cold, so I decided to go downstairs in my building to admire the view, but unfortunately I couldn’t go out because of the weather. Just a moment ago, I put on some gloves, and now I’ve decided to watch the movie Rampage, which was available on Netflix.
I didn’t have much time to do other things, and now I’m just lying in bed thinking about what I’m going to do throughout the night. I really enjoy watching anime on Netflix, but today I decided to just watch this movie, even though I’m not quite sure if I’ve seen it before or not.
